// Registry Scan Intake — channel C. TARGET_ARCHITECTURE.md §3.2, step 7.
//
// A document arrives physically at the registry counter. A clerk scans it, deposits the
// bytes directly to the configured flow endpoint, and the platform gets a correspondence
// record with the link already attached. Before this, channel C was metadata only: a clerk
// could log that a document existed but had nowhere to put it, so the record and the paper
// stayed in different places.
//
// TWO RULES THIS MODULE IS BUILT AROUND
//
//   1. NO RECORD WITHOUT A DEPOSIT. If the bytes did not reach the library, no
//      correspondence record is created. A registry record pointing at a document that was
//      never filed is a broken custody record — the same silent-loss failure as F-028 on
//      the portal, wearing an internal badge. Failed deposits stay in the tray, visible and
//      retryable, and say why.
//
//   2. CUSTODY IS ATTRIBUTED BY THE SERVER. `depositedBy` comes back from the endpoint, which
//      reads it from the verified token. This module never asserts who deposited a document,
//      because a client-asserted depositor is not a custody record.
//
// It creates correspondence as an ALLOWED INVOKER of the correspondence module's
// `create-correspondence` action rather than owning a second creation path, so a scanned
// record and a logged one are the same kind of thing with the same audit event.
