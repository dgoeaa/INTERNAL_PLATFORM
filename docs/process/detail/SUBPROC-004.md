## 5.10 Monitoring, audit and performance

| ID | Kind | Name | Description | Threshold | Escalation threshold | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| MON-011 | Audit event | Audit event audit:archived | The governance table binds action 'archive-reference' to the audit vocabulary 'audit:archived'. | — | — | Confirmed |

### Audit events written by this process

## Relationships

### Subprocesses

| ID | Name | Category | Activation |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| SUBPROC-026 | Archive the reference | Reusable governed write | An operator activates the control bound to this action. |
| SUBPROC-050 | Archive the file | Reusable governed write | An operator activates the control bound to this action. |

### Variants

| ID | Name | Kind | Differs from the primary path | Activation |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| VAR-004 | archive the file — raised from registry | Channel-specific variant | The same governed action, raised from registry instead of from its owner archive. | An operator working in registry takes the action. |

## Operational status

_No run record for this process is held among the supplied inputs. Nothing is claimed about whether it executes._
