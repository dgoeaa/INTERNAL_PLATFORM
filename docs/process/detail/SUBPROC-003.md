## 5.6 Decisions and branches

_No decision point is evidenced in this process._

## 5.7 Business rules and controls

### Controls

| ID | Type | Name | Description | Trigger | Condition | Expected behaviour | Outcome | Exception | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| CTRL-048 | Confirmation control | Operator confirmation — Deposit into the registry | The operator is shown what is about to happen and must confirm before the write is attempted. | The operator activates the control this dialog guards. | Confirmation is given. | The governed write proceeds. | Declining returns to the workspace with nothing written. | Not evidenced beyond the decline path. | Confirmed |

## 5.8 Outputs and completion

| Attribute | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Primary output | — |
| Completion criteria | — |
| Successful end state | — |
| Alternative end states | Not evidenced. |
| Failed end states | Not evidenced. |
| Cancellation outcome | Not evidenced. |
| Residual obligations | Not evidenced. |
| Records created or updated | — |
| Notifications issued | NOTIF-113 Deposited and recorded locally; synchronization queued<br>NOTIF-114 Nothing was deposited — the tray shows why |
| Downstream handoffs | — |

## 5.9 Exceptions, failures and recovery

_No exception path is evidenced in this process. Where the process is a request-triggered workflow, that absence is itself recorded in the gap register._

## 5.10 Monitoring, audit and performance

| ID | Kind | Name | Description | Threshold | Escalation threshold | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| MON-048 | Audit event | Audit event audit:scan-deposited | The governance table binds action 'scan-deposit' to the audit vocabulary 'audit:scan-deposited'. | — | — | Confirmed |

### Audit events written by this process

| Step | Audit event |
| --- | --- |
| STEP-0052 Lodge the scanned document | audit:scan-deposited |

## Relationships

### Subprocesses

| ID | Name | Category | Activation |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| SUBPROC-015 | Lodge the scanned document | Reusable governed write | An operator activates the control bound to this action. |

### Dependencies

| ID | Supporting | Kind | Type | Direction | Mandatory | Impact if unavailable |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| DEP-029 | Endpoint alias DYNAMIC_ACTIONS | Integration | Runtime integration call | Outbound - the workspace calls the endpoint | Not determinable from the call site alone; the governance table states per action whether the backend is required or optional. | The call fails. Whether the operator write survives depends on whether the action declares the backend required or optional. |
| DEP-041 | Endpoint DYNAMIC_ACTIONS | Integration | Direct HTTP call to a Power Automate flow | Outbound | Declared in the endpoint registry as a named alias. Whether a given call is mandatory is stated per action in the governance table, not here. | Every call routed through this alias fails. |

## Operational status

_No run record for this process is held among the supplied inputs. Nothing is claimed about whether it executes._
