| Segregation of duties | Not evidenced. No supplied artifact declares a separation requirement. |

## 5.3 Initiation and preconditions

## 5.4 Inputs

_No step-level inputs are evidenced for this process._

## 5.5 Stages and activities

_No steps are readable for this process from the supplied inputs. See the gap register._

## 5.6 Decisions and branches

_No decision point is evidenced in this process._

## 5.7 Business rules and controls

### Controls

| ID | Type | Name | Description | Trigger | Condition | Expected behaviour | Outcome | Exception | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| CTRL-054 | Confirmation control | Operator confirmation — Refresh the report rows | The operator is shown what is about to happen and must confirm before the write is attempted. | The operator activates the control this dialog guards. | Confirmation is given. | The governed write proceeds. | Declining returns to the workspace with nothing written. | Not evidenced beyond the decline path. | Confirmed |
| CTRL-055 | Confirmation control | Operator confirmation — Confirm report email | The operator is shown what is about to happen and must confirm before the write is attempted. | The operator activates the control this dialog guards. | Confirmation is given. | The governed write proceeds. | Declining returns to the workspace with nothing written. | Not evidenced beyond the decline path. | Confirmed |

## 5.8 Outputs and completion

| Attribute | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Primary output | A view over records already held. |
| Completion criteria | Not evidenced. This workspace declares no governed write of its own, so it has no completion event beyond leaving it. |
| Successful end state | Not evidenced. This workspace declares no governed write of its own, so it has no completion event beyond leaving it. |
| Alternative end states | Not evidenced. |
| Failed end states | Not evidenced. |
| Cancellation outcome | Not evidenced. |
| Residual obligations | Not evidenced. |
| Records created or updated | — |
| Notifications issued | NOTIF-128 No report rows for the selected range/templates<br>NOTIF-129 Report generated and downloaded<br>NOTIF-130 The registry has been asked for the current rows — they appear here when they arrive<br>NOTIF-131 The registry could not be reached, so nothing was refreshed. This report still shows the rows already on this device.<br>NOTIF-132 Add at least one recipient<br>NOTIF-133 Report email sent<br>NOTIF-134 The report could not be sent just now. It is held on this device and goes out when the connection is back. |
| Downstream handoffs | — |

## 5.9 Exceptions, failures and recovery

_No exception path is evidenced in this process. Where the process is a request-triggered workflow, that absence is itself recorded in the gap register._

## 5.10 Monitoring, audit and performance

_No monitoring control, metric, service-level expectation or audit event is evidenced for this process._

## Relationships

### Dependencies

| ID | Supporting | Kind | Type | Direction | Mandatory | Impact if unavailable |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| DEP-031 | Endpoint alias EMAIL | Integration | Runtime integration call | Outbound - the workspace calls the endpoint | Not determinable from the call site alone; the governance table states per action whether the backend is required or optional. | The call fails. Whether the operator write survives depends on whether the action declares the backend required or optional. |
| DEP-042 | Endpoint EMAIL | Integration | Direct HTTP call to a Power Automate flow | Outbound | Declared in the endpoint registry as a named alias. Whether a given call is mandatory is stated per action in the governance table, not here. | Every call routed through this alias fails. |

## Operational status

_No run record for this process is held among the supplied inputs. Nothing is claimed about whether it executes._
