| Description | Track items at risk of breaching their service-level target before they do. |
| Business objective | Track items at risk of breaching their service-level target before they do. |
| Operational objective | Boundary role 'priority-intervention'. Owns fasttrack, urgent-assign, escalate-priority, notify-owner; must not own normal-task-workbench, formal-approval. |

## 5.4 Inputs

| Step | Required inputs |
| --- | --- |
| STEP-0024 | The record the operator has selected, and any values captured by the form attached to the control. |

## 5.5 Stages and activities

1 step(s).

## 5.6 Decisions and branches

_No decision point is evidenced in this process._

## 5.7 Business rules and controls

### Controls

| ID | Type | Name | Description | Trigger | Condition | Expected behaviour | Outcome | Exception | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| CTRL-034 | Confirmation control | Operator confirmation — Resolve escalation | The operator is shown what is about to happen and must confirm before the write is attempted. | The operator activates the control this dialog guards. | Confirmation is given. | The governed write proceeds. | Declining returns to the workspace with nothing written. | Not evidenced beyond the decline path. | Confirmed |

## 5.8 Outputs and completion

| Attribute | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Primary output | An updated record and an audit entry. |
| Completion criteria | The operator completes one of its governed writes: resolve-escalation. |
| Successful end state | The operator completes one of its governed writes: resolve-escalation. |
| Alternative end states | Not evidenced. |
| Failed end states | Not evidenced. |
| Cancellation outcome | Not evidenced. |
| Residual obligations | Not evidenced. |
| Records created or updated | — |
| Notifications issued | NOTIF-069 Escalation resolved<br>NOTIF-070 The registry could not be reached, so nothing was reloaded. Try again, or contact IT support if it keeps failing. |
| Downstream handoffs | — |

## 5.9 Exceptions, failures and recovery

_No exception path is evidenced in this process. Where the process is a request-triggered workflow, that absence is itself recorded in the gap register._

| ID | Kind | Name | Description | Threshold | Escalation threshold | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
