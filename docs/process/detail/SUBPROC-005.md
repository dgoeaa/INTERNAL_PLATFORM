| Downstream handoffs | — |

## 5.9 Exceptions, failures and recovery

_No exception path is evidenced in this process. Where the process is a request-triggered workflow, that absence is itself recorded in the gap register._

## 5.10 Monitoring, audit and performance

| ID | Kind | Name | Description | Threshold | Escalation threshold | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| MON-051 | Audit event | Audit event audit:user-disabled | The governance table binds action 'disable-user' to the audit vocabulary 'audit:user-disabled'. | — | — | Confirmed |
| MON-052 | Audit event | Audit event audit:user-created | The governance table binds action 'create-user' to the audit vocabulary 'audit:user-created'. | — | — | Confirmed |
| MON-053 | Audit event | Audit event audit:user-updated | The governance table binds action 'update-user' to the audit vocabulary 'audit:user-updated'. | — | — | Confirmed |
| MON-054 | Audit event | Audit event audit:user-role-assigned | The governance table binds action 'assign-role' to the audit vocabulary 'audit:user-role-assigned'. | — | — | Confirmed |

### Audit events written by this process

| Step | Audit event |
| --- | --- |
| STEP-0055 Disable the user | audit:user-disabled |
| STEP-0056 Create the user | audit:user-created |
| STEP-0057 Update the user | audit:user-updated |

## Relationships

### Subprocesses

| ID | Name | Category | Activation |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| SUBPROC-034 | Create the user | Reusable governed write | An operator activates the control bound to this action. |
| SUBPROC-035 | Update the user | Reusable governed write | An operator activates the control bound to this action. |
| SUBPROC-036 | Disable the user | Reusable governed write | An operator activates the control bound to this action. |
| SUBPROC-037 | assign-role | Reusable governed write | An operator activates the control bound to this action. |

### Dependencies

| ID | Supporting | Kind | Type | Direction | Mandatory | Impact if unavailable |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| DEP-032 | Endpoint alias DYNAMIC_ACTIONS | Integration | Runtime integration call | Outbound - the workspace calls the endpoint | Not determinable from the call site alone; the governance table states per action whether the backend is required or optional. | The call fails. Whether the operator write survives depends on whether the action declares the backend required or optional. |
| DEP-041 | Endpoint DYNAMIC_ACTIONS | Integration | Direct HTTP call to a Power Automate flow | Outbound | Declared in the endpoint registry as a named alias. Whether a given call is mandatory is stated per action in the governance table, not here. | Every call routed through this alias fails. |

## Operational status
