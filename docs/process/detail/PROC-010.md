## 5.1 Identity and purpose

| Attribute | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Identifier | PROC-010 |
| Name | Tracking & Monitoring |
| Alternative or legacy name | Route 'response-tracking' |
| Category | User-initiated · operational |
| Description | Monitor responses, SLA ageing, matched document/email tracking and exports. |
| Description declared in the artifact itself | — |
| Business objective | Monitor responses, SLA ageing, matched document/email tracking and exports. |
| Operational objective | Boundary role 'response-monitoring-lens'. Owns monitor-response, ageing, export-monitoring, route-to-owner; must not own task-execution, approval-decision. |

| Evidence classification | Confirmed |
| Evidence note | Declared in the workspace configuration, implemented by a module of the same route name, and bounded by the module boundary charter. |
| Documentation status | Documented in part; named attributes outstanding |
| Validation status | No external validation required |

## 5.2 Participants and responsibilities

| Attribute | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Initiating actor | An operator holding a role with access to this route. |
| Participating roles | systemAdmin<br>executive<br>director<br>operator<br>viewer |
| Accountable owner | Not evidenced — recorded as an ownership gap. |
| Supporting systems | DGO Internal Platform |
| Approval authority | Not evidenced for this process. |
| Escalation authority | Not evidenced for this process. |
| Segregation of duties | Not evidenced. No supplied artifact declares a separation requirement. |

## 5.3 Initiation and preconditions

| Attribute | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Starting event | An operator opens the route from the sidebar, or another workspace hands them the record. |
| Trigger type | User-initiated · operational |
| Entry criteria | canAccess() admits the role to this route. |
| Required roles and permissions | systemAdmin<br>executive<br>director<br>operator<br>viewer |
| Required configuration | modules/response-tracking.js |
| Required system availability | DGO Internal Platform |
| Scheduling conditions | None: this process is not scheduled. |

## 5.4 Inputs

_No step-level inputs are evidenced for this process._

## 5.5 Stages and activities

_No steps are readable for this process from the supplied inputs. See the gap register._

## 5.6 Decisions and branches

_No decision point is evidenced in this process._

## 5.7 Business rules and controls

### Controls

| ID | Type | Name | Description | Trigger | Condition | Expected behaviour | Outcome | Exception | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| CTRL-046 | Confirmation control | Operator confirmation — Acknowledge this task in My Work | The operator is shown what is about to happen and must confirm before the write is attempted. | The operator activates the control this dialog guards. | Confirmation is given. | The governed write proceeds. | Declining returns to the workspace with nothing written. | Not evidenced beyond the decline path. | Confirmed |
| CTRL-047 | Confirmation control | Operator confirmation — Forward this task to the Registry | The operator is shown what is about to happen and must confirm before the write is attempted. | The operator activates the control this dialog guards. | Confirmation is given. | The governed write proceeds. | Declining returns to the workspace with nothing written. | Not evidenced beyond the decline path. | Confirmed |

## 5.8 Outputs and completion

| Attribute | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Primary output | A view over records already held. |
| Completion criteria | Not evidenced. This workspace declares no governed write of its own, so it has no completion event beyond leaving it. |
| Successful end state | Not evidenced. This workspace declares no governed write of its own, so it has no completion event beyond leaving it. |
| Alternative end states | Not evidenced. |
| Failed end states | Not evidenced. |
| Cancellation outcome | Not evidenced. |
| Residual obligations | Not evidenced. |
| Records created or updated | — |
| Notifications issued | NOTIF-110 There is nothing in this list to export<br>NOTIF-111 Forwarded to the Registry<br>NOTIF-112 Recorded on this device — it will reach the Registry when the connection returns |
| Downstream handoffs | Workspace orchestrator<br>Workspace registry |

## 5.9 Exceptions, failures and recovery

_No exception path is evidenced in this process. Where the process is a request-triggered workflow, that absence is itself recorded in the gap register._

## 5.10 Monitoring, audit and performance

_No monitoring control, metric, service-level expectation or audit event is evidenced for this process._

## Relationships

### Dependencies

| ID | Supporting | Kind | Type | Direction | Mandatory | Impact if unavailable |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| DEP-026 | Endpoint alias DYNAMIC_ACTIONS | Integration | Runtime integration call | Outbound - the workspace calls the endpoint | Not determinable from the call site alone; the governance table states per action whether the backend is required or optional. | The call fails. Whether the operator write survives depends on whether the action declares the backend required or optional. |
| DEP-027 | Workspace orchestrator | Process | Process handoff | Downstream - this workspace sends the operator and the selected record on | Optional: the handoff is taken only on the path that navigates. | The operator cannot complete the onward step from here; the record stays in its current state. |
| DEP-028 | Workspace registry | Process | Process handoff | Downstream - this workspace sends the operator and the selected record on | Optional: the handoff is taken only on the path that navigates. | The operator cannot complete the onward step from here; the record stays in its current state. |
| DEP-041 | Endpoint DYNAMIC_ACTIONS | Integration | Direct HTTP call to a Power Automate flow | Outbound | Declared in the endpoint registry as a named alias. Whether a given call is mandatory is stated per action in the governance table, not here. | Every call routed through this alias fails. |

## Operational status

_No run record for this process is held among the supplied inputs. Nothing is claimed about whether it executes._
