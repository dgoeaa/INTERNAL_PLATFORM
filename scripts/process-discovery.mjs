 * classes. A statement is CONFIRMED only when an artifact states it directly. Anything
 * derived by reasoning across two artifacts is INFERRED and says so. Where this standard
 * asks for a field no supplied artifact carries, the field is left out of the record and the
 * absence is raised in the gap register rather than filled with a plausible-sounding value.
 *
 * This script records what the evidence shows EXISTS and how it is wired. It does not decide
 * whether a process WORKS: operational status comes from run records and is carried in a
 * separate field so the two are never confused.
